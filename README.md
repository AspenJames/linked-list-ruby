# Linked List with Tail Pointer

## Structure

There are two Ruby classes: Element and LinkedList. The definitions for these
are in `lib/`. There is a test suite written using RSpec, those files are
located in `spec/`.

## Tests

To run the automated tests, first install all dependencies, then issue the
`rspec` command:

```bash
bundle install
rspec
```
There is a configuration file that sets some default display options for the
test runner, feel free to edit these or delete the `.rspec` file.
